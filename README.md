Ever wanted to see multiple channels in discord at once? Now's the future!

Also allows for embeding certain links as desired.

# Todo and Bugs:

1. Can only get the links to open up if they're in the 'background', i.e. ctrl or middle click. 

2. Background views aren't getting deleted when closed

3. Detects discord app when making a new embed and asks for relogin
